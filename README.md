# Entrepreneurship-in-Students
My first python class project
Here I obtained a dataset from kaggle.com which was about students who ventured in entrepreneurship.
With the dataset, I was able to create visuals which described metadata of the students.
I was able to obtain traits that they had which made them unique with those who were not in the entrepreneurship field.
Using pandas and numpy, I cleaned the data set from null values and also removed unnecessary data.
